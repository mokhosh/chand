# Chand
"Chand" means "how much" in Farsi. 
This is a simple application to keep track of coin / currency prices in Iran.

## Price Source
I use this url to scrape coin / currency prices for today:
```
http://platform.tgju.org/fa/api/webservice-snippet/?token=webservice&items=sekeb,sekee,nim,rob,gerami&opts=diff,time&placeholder=tgju-data&hostname=
```
which in turn was extracted from this one:
```
http://www.tgju.org/webservice/global/snippet-loader.php?token=webservice&items=sekeb,sekee,nim,rob,gerami&opts=diff,time&placeholder=tgju-data
```
